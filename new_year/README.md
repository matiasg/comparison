This was a sequel of [this twitt](https://twitter.com/fermatslibrary/status/1476946554930012160)

In short, it states that
(10 + 9) * 8 * (7 + 6) + (5 + 4) * (3 + 2) + 1 = 2022
(it was tweeted on Dec 31, 2021)

The exercise consists on trying all different ways for associating numbers
from 10 to 1 and all different ways to put `+`, `*` and `-` between them
and writing how many positive numbers are obtained this way.

Generalization: do that for any N, not only for N = 10.

Nice to have, write different ways to obtain the following years,
let's say from 2023 to 2030, if they can be obtained.
